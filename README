Install:
To intall this layer you need to add it to the config/bblayer.conf and source/layer.txt files.
This layer needs kdelibsX-dev or kdelibsX.devel installed (either kdelibs4 or kdelibs5).

Please note that it is a good advice to delete the tmp and sstate directories when adding or removing layers,
in the meta-kde case there will be problems with dependencies (qt4) otherwise.
(Alternatively it would be faster to rebuild just Qt with "bitbake -ccleansstate qt4-x11-free && bitbake qt4-x11-free")

FAQ / Troubleshooting:
1.
  Q: How can I contribute my patches / recipes to this layer?
  A: Send a merge request to one of the layer maintainers, don't forget to add your name to the contributors list.

2.
  Q: A recipe does not build, breaks parsing, what to do?
  A: This layer is still work in progress, breakage can happen at any time.
     Contact a layer maintainer, if the problem is easy to fix send a patch.
     If the error is not that simple, wait until the issue is fixed (or disable this layer if parsing fails).

3.
  Q; Why is this layer incompatible with Poky?
  A: Poky has no giflib recipe.
    Solving this issue: Either add the meta-openembedded layer to Pokys layer configuration,
    or provide a giflib recipe copy in your personal overlay.
