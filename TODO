Currently to be done:

plasma-active:
-Fix the CMake error at kde-workspace that pretents that Qt can't be found when it actually found a bogus value in the cached variables
--Very mysterious error that only happens after ccleansstate?
--Error message is:
| -- Qt's moc NOT found!
| -- Qt's uic NOT found!
| -- Qt's rcc NOT found!
--But Qt is actually found, re running the task will not give this error again!
-runtest on OpenEmbedded compatible hardware

kde-workspace:
-Fix host includes, indicated in log.do_comile "-I/usr/include/KDE"

all recipes:
-Add proper packaging, currently there is almost no recipe packaging.
-Check if licenses really match, most licenses are matching, but not all may.
-Change to a unified form of variable order (aka. clean up the recipes structure).
