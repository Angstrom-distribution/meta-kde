Currently to be done:

plasma-active:
-Fix the CMake error at kde-workspace that pretents that Qt can't be found when it actually found a bogus value in the cached variables
-test on OpenEmbedded compatible hardware


all recipes:
-Fix packages that install their CMake files to the libdir due to KDE developer mistakes (looks like INSTALL ... ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/cmake/KDE4Workspace)
--This is a serious problem as it affects many recipes and causes "Bad RPATH" QA issues, unvortunately it can only get fixed by adding proper cross compiling support to KDE.
-Check if licenses really match, the license variables were just copied over assuming that it is GPLv2 conform.
-Change to a unified form of variable order (aka. clean up the recipes structure).

-Find a upstreamable solution to add "out of the box" KDE cross compiling support
--Fix hardcoded install directories and library targets in KDEs CMake files (see *relwithdebinfo*.cmake files)
