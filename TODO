Currently to be done:

plasma-active:
-Fix the CMake error at kde-workspace that pretents that Qt can't be found when it actually found a bogus value in the cached variables
--Very misterious error that only happens after ccleansstate?
--Error message is:
| -- Qt's moc NOT found!
| -- Qt's uic NOT found!
| -- Qt's rcc NOT found!
--But Qt is actually found, re running the task will not give this error again!
-runtest on OpenEmbedded compatible hardware


all recipes:
-Fix packages that install their CMake files to the libdir due to lacking knowledge about FHS (looks like INSTALL ... ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/cmake/KDE4Workspace)
--This is a serious problem as it affects many recipes and causes "Bad RPATH" QA issues, unvortunately it can only get fixed by adding proper cross compiling support to KDE.
-Check if licenses really match, the license variables were just copied over assuming that it is GPLv2 conform.
-Change to a unified form of variable order (aka. clean up the recipes structure).


Poky:
-Wait until meta-openembedded has less overhead ;)
